<b>
Naguib Mahfouz, born in Egypt in 1911, won a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988.
He is one of the most recognized Egyptian writers, publishing numerous novels, short stories, journalism, memoirs, essays and screenplays.
Since he was young, Mahfouz loved reading and writing and was inspired by the likes of Franz Kafka and James Joyce.
Mahfouz is the only Arab to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He said, â€œThe Nobel Prize has given me, for the first time in my life, the feeling that my literature could be appreciated on an international level.
The Arab world also won the Nobel with me.
I believe that international doors have opened, and that from now on, literate people will consider Arab literature also.
We deserve that recognition.
